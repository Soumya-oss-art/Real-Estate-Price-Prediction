# Real-Estate-Price-Prediction
## Project Overview

The Real Estate Price Predictor is a machine learning-based application designed to estimate the price of residential properties in Bangalore. Using key property features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and amenities, the model predicts an estimated market value to help buyers, sellers, and real estate agents make informed decisions.

This project demonstrates how data analysis and machine learning can be leveraged for real estate market insights.

# Features

* Predictive Model: Predicts house prices in Bangalore based on multiple property attributes.
* User-Friendly Interface: Users can input property details and receive an instant price estimate.
* Data Insights: Provides analysis of property trends in Bangalore, including popular localities, average prices, and property types.
* Scalable & Extensible: Can be extended to include more cities or integrate real-time property listings.

# Dataset

*The dataset contains historical property listings in Bangalore.
* Key columns include:
* location – locality of the property
* size – total square footage
* bhk – number of bedrooms
* bath – number of bathrooms
* price – target variable (in INR)
* Dataset source: Collected from online real estate portals (or Kaggle dataset if applicable).

# Model

* Algorithm: Random Forest Regressor (can be replaced with Linear Regression, XGBoost, etc.)
* Features: Location, Size, BHK, Bathroom, etc.
## Performance:
* Mean Absolute Error (MAE): example: ₹35,000
* R² Score: example: 0.92

# Future Enhancements
* Incorporate more features like floor number, year built, and amenities.
* Expand predictions to other cities in India.
* Deploy as a web app or mobile application for real-time predictions.
